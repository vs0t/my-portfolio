        <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
        <p>This was my first at-home project, to try and help me understand python better. The program is to calculate bmi, and also translate U.S measurement system to the metric system, and then calculate and display the bmi. </p>

        <h3>Casino Game</h3>
        <p>This was my second at-home python project. It is a simple game where you bet on a number of lines, and like at a casino if they line up in any row you bet on, the subsequent amount of money is deposited back in your account. If the spin doesnt hit, the subsequent money is taken out of the account. Once the player loses all balance, the game is over and is unable to run anymore.</p>
