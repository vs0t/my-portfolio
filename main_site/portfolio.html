      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a hardworking young man with a deep-rooted passion for technology that began in my early years. Growing up surrounded by the ever-changing tech landscape, my interest naturally grew, leading me to experiment with various systems and explore the intricacies of coding and networking. I find fulfillment in understanding the essential elements that power our digital world. My journey in the tech field has been driven by curiosity and a genuine love for unraveling the complexities of technology. My passion for technology allows for me to adapt quickly to new challenges, and also enables me to pick up on and utilize new information quicker.</p>

        <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
        <p>This was my first at-home project, to try and help me understand python better. The program is to calculate bmi, and also translate U.S measurement system to the metric system, and then calculate and display the bmi. </p>

        <h3>Casino Game</h3>
        <p>This was my second at-home python project. It is a simple game where you bet on a number of lines, and like at a casino if they line up in any row you bet on, the subsequent amount of money is deposited back in your account. If the spin doesnt hit, the subsequent money is taken out of the account. Once the player loses all balance, the game is over and is unable to run anymore.</p>

        <h3>Discord Python Bot</h3>
        <p>This Discord Python Bot, my third at-home python project, is a versatile and interactive bot designed to enhance the functionality of Discord servers. It features a variety of functionalities including the ability to play audio from YouTube, send reminders via text messages to specified phone numbers, provide weather updates for specific locations, manage game mods for Cyberpunk and Minecraft, and more. The bot also supports a unique 'Lamester Quotes' feature, allowing users to add and store quotes, which are then periodically sent to a designated channel. Integrated with a MySQL database for storing mod information, and capable of audio playback through FFmpeg, this bot serves as a multifunctional tool for server members, enhancing engagement and interaction within the community.</p>
